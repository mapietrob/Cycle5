# Creature Identity Test

## Description / Purpose
The Creature Identity Test is an engaging web application that invites users to discover their mythical creature counterpart through a series of personality-based questions. This unique experience combines interactive storytelling with a simple quiz format, allowing users to explore various mythical creatures and their corresponding descriptions. Developed using PHP, MySQL, and advanced web technologies, the application provides a seamless and immersive journey into a world of fantasy, offering personalized results complete with creature illustrations.

## Dependencies
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher
- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or web server document root.
2. Import the `creature_test.sql` file into your MySQL database to set up the necessary tables. (Adjust this step based on your actual database schema file name, if different.)
3. Configure your database connection in `connect.php` with your database user, password, and database name.
4. Access the application through your web browser by navigating to the directory where the files are located. Start the quiz by clicking on the "Start Test" button on the homepage.

## Future Work
- Implement user authentication to allow users to save their results and view past outcomes.
- Enhance the quiz with more questions and a broader range of creatures, incorporating user feedback to refine personality match accuracy.
- Expand the application's lore by including detailed habitats, histories, and stories for each creature, encouraging users to explore more about their mythical counterparts.
